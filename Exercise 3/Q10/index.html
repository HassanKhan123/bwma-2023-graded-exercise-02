      In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that
      I've been turning over in my mind ever since. "Whenever you feel like
      criticizing any one", he told me, "just remember that all the people in
      this world haven't had the advantages that you've had".
    </p>

    <p>Reserving judgements is a matter of <em>infinite</em> hope.</p>
    <p>There was something unique about Gatsby:</p>

    <blockquote>
      He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of
      those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you
      may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to
      face--the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you
      with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as
      far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to
      believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression
      of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.
    </blockquote>

      “And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of
      Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of
      Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must
      have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not
      know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity
      beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the
      night.
      <u>Gatsby believed in the green light</u>, the orgastic future that year
      by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no
      matter—to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . And
      one fine morning——
